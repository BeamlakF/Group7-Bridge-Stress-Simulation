# ðŸŒ‰ Bridge Stress Simulation

An interactive 3D simulation that visualizes how a bridge responds to different loads in real-time. Built with Three.js, Cannon-es, and Vite, this project combines physics, color-based stress visualization, and an immersive environment.

# Features

## Interactive Bridge
- Custom 15-segment bridge with railings and vertical supports.
- Gold spheres represent weight points â€” drag and drop to simulate load.
- Each sphere independently affects local stress and deformation.

## Stress Visualization
- Bridge segments transition from **blue (safe)** to **red (danger)** based on local stress.
- Visual feedback is updated in real-time as weights are applied or removed.

## Physics Simulation
- Powered by **Cannon-es** for basic physics and gravity.
- Stress simulation and deformation mimic realistic structural behavior.

## Rich Environment
- Animated forest with 100+ trees, rocks, fog, and reflective water.
- Atmospheric lighting, shadows, and ambient effects for realism.

## Camera & Controls
- **OrbitControls** for user-friendly interaction.
- Responsive UI includes instructions and a color-coded stress legend.
